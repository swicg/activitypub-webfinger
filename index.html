    <p>Identifiers in ActivityPub tend to be HTTPS URIs. The use of WebFinger (as defined in [[RFC7033]]) allows for discovery of an actor's identifier given a username and a hostname, which may be more socially salient or otherwise easier to communicate across various contexts and media. The username and hostname are resolved at the WebFinger endpoint of the hostname in order to discover a link to an actor associated with the user's account, and that actor similarly can be back-linked to the username and hostname.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Consider an HTTPS URI of the form <code>https://social.example/actors/9c5b94b1-35ad-49bb-b118-8e8fc24abf80</code> being used as an identifier for an actor associated with a user account. Communicating this digitally may be done by simply using the HTTPS URI as-is, as a hyperlink reference. However, communicating this verbally or in a space-constrained visual format can be difficult. WebFinger allows communicating aliases of the form <code>alyssa@social.example</code>, which are easier to work with in the previously-cited cases.</p>
    <p>Additional benefits of using WebFinger include smoothing over the differences between varying actor URI schemas. Different softwares may provide human-friendly URLs for an actor's profile, but these URLs may take several different forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>https://social.example/alyssa</code></li>
      <li><code>https://social.example/@alyssa</code></li>
      <li><code>https://social.example/~alyssa</code></li>
      <li><code>https://social.example/u/alyssa</code></li>
      <li>...and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Conventionally, people can be identified by their user@domain address, while documents can be identified by their HTTPS location.</p>

  <section class="normative" id="discovery">
    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p>Discovery can occur in one of two directions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Given a WebFinger address, one can resolve it to an actor document;</li>
      <li>Given an actor document with a preferredUsername, one can reconstruct a WebFinger address that should link back to the same actor document.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The former will be referred to as "forward discovery" and the latter will be referred to as "reverse discovery".</p>
    <section id="forward-discovery">
      <h3>Forward discovery of an actor document given a WebFinger address</h3>
      <p>Given a username and hostname in the form <code>user@domain</code>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Construct an <code>acct:</code> URI of the form <code>acct:user@domain</code> (as defined in [[RFC7565]])</li>
        <li>Make an HTTP GET request to that hostname's WebFinger well-known endpoint, using the <code>acct:</code> URI as the value of the <code>resource</code> query parameter (as described in [[RFC7033]])</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For example, the WebFinger address <code>alyssa@social.example</code> can be resolved as a resource by making an HTTP GET request for <code>https://social.example/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:alyssa@social.example</code> (or <code>https://social.example/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:alyssa%40social.example</code> if percent-encoded). This request MUST returns a JRD (JSON Resource Descriptor, as defined in [[RFC6415]]) with <code>application/jrd+json</code> as the content type (assuming no specified <code>Accept</code> header).</p>
      <p>The WebFinger request and response may look like this:</p>
<pre class="http example" title="Sample JRD response">
GET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:alyssa@social.example HTTP/1.1
Host: social.example

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/jrd+json

{
  "subject": "acct:alyssa@social.example",
  "aliases": [
    "https://social.example/@alyssa",
    "https://social.example/actors/9c5b94b1-35ad-49bb-b118-8e8fc24abf80"
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page",
      "type": "text/html",
      "href": "https://social.example/@alyssa"
    },
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "type": "application/activity+json",
      "href": "https://social.example/actors/9c5b94b1-35ad-49bb-b118-8e8fc24abf80"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
      <p>At this point, you can parse for the <code>href</code> of the element of <code>links</code> that has a <code>rel</code> of <code>self</code> and a <code>type</code> of either <code>application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"</code> or <code>application/activity+json</code> (depending on the implementation). See <a href="#link"></a> for more information about this.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="reverse-discovery">
      <h3>Reverse discovery of a WebFinger address given an actor document</h3>
      <p>Given an actor with an <code>id</code> and a <code>preferredUsername</code>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take the hostname of the <code>id</code> to discover the WebFinger domain</li>
        <li>Combine the <code>preferredUsername</code> and the WebFinger domain in order to form a WebFinger address</li>
        <li>Verify that this WebFinger address links back to the same actor when performing discovery as described in <a href="#forward-discovery"></a></li>
        <li>Optionally: If the <code>subject</code> from the previous step contains an <code>acct:</code> URI different from the one you constructed, perform a verification discovery against that <code>acct:</code> URI afterward. (In such cases, the <code>subject</code> of the JRD denotes the expected canonical identifier.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For example, given an actor document at <code>https://activitypub.example.com/actor/1</code> like so:</p>
<pre class="json example" title="Sample actor document">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://activitypub.example.com/actor/1",
  "preferredUsername": "alice"
}
</pre>
      <p>The reverse discovery process would extract <code>alice</code> and <code>activitypub.example.com</code>, construct the <code>acct:</code> URI <code>acct:alice@activitypub.example.com</code>, then request <code>https://activitypub.example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:alice@activitypub.example.com</code> like so:</p>
<pre class="http example" title="Verifying the constructed WebFinger address">
GET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:alice@activitypub.example.com HTTP/1.1
Host: activitypub.example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/jrd+json

{
  "subject": "acct:alice@example.com",
  "aliases": [
    "https://example.com/@alice",
    "https://activitypub.example.com/actors/1"
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page",
      "type": "text/html",
      "href": "https://example.com/@alice"
    },
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "type": "application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\"",
      "href": "https://activitypub.example.com/actors/1"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
      <p>At this point, we have validated that <code>alice@activitypub.example.com</code> links back to our actor document, but we can optionally verify that the canonical WebFinger address of <code>alice@example.com</code> also links back to the same actor document:</p>
<pre class="http example" title="Verifying the canonical WebFinger address discovered from the constructed WebFinger address">

    <h2>Encoding</h2>
    <p>To ensure smooth operation of the WebFinger discovery flows, identifiers and responses should follow certain guidelines for encoding.</p>
    <section class="normative" id="names">
      <h3>Limitations on usernames and hostnames</h3>
      <p>The <code>acct:</code> URI scheme is defined in [[RFC7565]], which contains ABNF for allowed characters (inheriting from [[RFC3986]] as well):</p>
<pre class="abnf" title="acct: URI ABNF">
acctURI      = "acct" ":" userpart "@" host
userpart     = unreserved / sub-delims
               0*( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

unreserved   = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
sub-delims   = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
pct-encoded  = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

host         = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
reg-name     = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
</pre>
      <p>Further restrictions are specified in [[RFC7565]]:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Per [[RFC3986]] Section 6.2.2.1 "Case Normalization", the scheme and host are case-insensitive and SHOULD therefore be normalized to lowercase.</li>
        <li>Per [[RFC3986]] Section 6.2.2.2 "Percent-Encoding Normalization", any <code>unreserved</code> characters SHOULD be decoded if encountered as a percent-encoded octet.</li>
        <li>Before percent-encoding anything, the userpart MUST consist only of Unicode code points that are part of the [[RFC7564]] PRECIS <code>IdentifierClass</code>
        </li>
        <li>Before percent-encoding anything, the hostname MUST conform to IDNA rules specified in [[RFC5982]] and [[RFC5980]] for A-label (ASCII-Compatible Encoding, or Punycode)</li>
      </ul>
      <section class="informative" id="rules">
        <h4>Current implementation rules</h4>
        <p>Note that while there are several symbols allowed in the userpart, the de facto limits set by some current implementers are much more restrictive.</p>
        <p>At the time of this writing, Mastodon enforces the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The username must be at least one character</li>
          <li>ASCII alphanumeric characters (<code>A</code> through <code>Z</code>, <code>a</code> through <code>z</code>, <code>0</code> through <code>9</code>) and underscores (<code>_</code>) are generally allowed anywhere in the username</li>
          <li>Dots (<code>.</code>) and dashes (<code>-</code>) are allowed in the middle of a username, but not as the first character or the last character</li>
          <li>All other symbols are disallowed</li>
          <li>Usernames are case-insensitive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In other words, Mastodon will accept the regular expression or the following ABNF:</p>
<pre class="abnf" title="Mastodon username ABNF">
; As a regular expression, this can be expressed as follows:
; /[a-z0-9_]+([a-z0-9_.-]+[a-z0-9_]+)?/i

username = word
           *( rest )
word     = ALPHA / DIGIT / "_"
rest     = *( extended )
           word
extended = start / "." / "-"
</pre>
        <p>Similarly at the time of this writing, Misskey is subject to the following limitations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Usernames are limited to 128 characters</li>
          <li>Hostnames are limited to 128 characters</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="normative" id="usernames">
        <h4>Recommendations for handling usernames</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Implementers SHOULD treat local usernames as case-insensitive.</li>
          <li>Implementers SHOULD NOT assume case insensitivity for external usernames.</li>

    <section class="normative" id="link">
      <h3>Establishing a link between the WebFinger resource and the actor document</h3>
      <p>As discussed in <a href="#forward-discovery"></a>, the link to the actor associated with a given WebFinger address will have the following qualifiers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>rel</code> MUST be <code>self</code></li>
        <li><code>type</code> MUST be either <code>application/activity+json</code> or <code>application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Publishers SHOULD include only one such link.</p>
      <p>Due to the prevailing use of WebFinger addresses as canonical primary identifiers for users, implementations that require WebFinger for compatibility will often also deduplicate actors based on the WebFinger address. Therefore, it is generally expected that there is only one <code>self</code> link to an Activity Streams document, in a unary relationship. However, some implementations do not follow this expectation, and there might be multiple links to ActivityStreams documents for the same WebFinger <code>acct:</code> resource. In such cases, one of the following strategies may be employed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take the first matching entry in `links`</li>
        <li>Deduplicate all matching entries in `links` by their `href`</li>
        <li>Check for additional information, such as the presence of `properties` which may give further hints as to which entry of `links` is appropriate to follow</li>
      </ul>

  </section>
  <section class="informative" id="security">
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>Using WebFinger can provide proof of existence of an associated actor document, as well as make it easier to discover that associated actor document; following this, an actor's inbox can be likewise discovered, and spam or other unwanted messages can be delivered to that actor's inbox. It may be desirable for some systems to not publicly expose an actor's existence and instead rely on the user manually entering their actor's HTTPS URI, or maintaining a "contact list" of bookmarked actors or resources. For such systems, the use of WebFinger is not advisable.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="informative" id="future">
    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <p>The current use of WebFinger with ActivityPub could be improved in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Back-linking an actor to a WebFinger address could be more explicit. Current use of <code>preferredUsername</code> is not ideal for constructing WebFinger addresses, and it also does not allow for expressing actual "preferred usernames". An explicit property for denoting the user's "canonical" WebFinger address would ease reverse-discovery concerns.</li>
      <li>Implementers could ease their de facto WebFinger requirements by treating WebFinger addresses purely as aliases for the actor's HTTPS identifier, rather than as the canonical identifier. This would make WebFinger address mappings mutable and no longer unary.</li>
      <li>WebFinger could be used to expose certain properties or qualified links more directly, skipping the resolution of the actor resource.</li>
      <li>An ActivityStreams profile of WebFinger can be defined in order to redirect or directly resolve the actor document if the <code>Accept</code> header specifies the correct media type, skipping the resolution of the JRD.</li>
    </ul>
